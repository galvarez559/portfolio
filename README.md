# Gio Portfolio Starter

A minimal static portfolio you can deploy to Netlify, Vercel, or GitHub Pages â€” and point your GoDaddy domain at it.

## Quick Start
1. Edit the HTML files to add your details.
2. Put your family video in `assets/family.mp4` **(only if it's small)** or replace the YouTube `VIDEO_ID` in `videos.html`.
3. Deploy:
   - **Netlify**: Drag & drop this folder onto https://app.netlify.com/drop or connect your GitHub repo.
   - **Vercel**: Import the repo at https://vercel.com/new.
   - **GitHub Pages**: Push to a repo and enable Pages in repo settings.

## Domain
After deploying, add `gio-devops-projects.com` in your hosting provider's domain settings; it will show the exact DNS records to copy into GoDaddy.
